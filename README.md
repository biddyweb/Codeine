ClangKit
========

About
-----

ClangKit provides an Objective-C frontend to LibClang. 
Source tokenization, diagnostics and fix-its are actually implemented.

ClangKit is intended to be used as a private framework, in an application's bundle.  
Possible applications includes:

 * Source code syntax highlighting
 * Source code tokenization
 * Source code diagnostics
 * Source code static analysis

### Language support

The project actually supports parsing C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ source code.

### iOS note

The project is not yet compatible with iOS, but everything should be fine, as LibClang is actually compiled as a static library.
